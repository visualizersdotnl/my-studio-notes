* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached

Solutions:
- Clean and reseat all: go from there

Try out sampling: format a lousy disk and try to record the DX7.

Options for screw removal:
- Rubber band
- Pliers (good ones)
- Special bit

[ Environment ]

- More desk space!
- Upgrade mixer
- Plateaus, maybe ask Maurits to design something?
