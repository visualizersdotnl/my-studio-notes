* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached

Solutions:
- Clean and reseat all: go from there

Try out sampling: format a lousy disk and try to record the DX7.

[ Cables ]

I need more:

More long jack & XLR-to-jack cables (for mixer to rack mixer, just use 2 channels!)

[ Environment ]

- More desk space for SL-1200s!

[ Notes ]

Never trust that your Beyer's are broken unless you can check this using a reputable *direct* source!
Pick up Juno-106 @ Thorsten
