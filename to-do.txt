[ Gear / Maintenance ]

* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

Issues:
- It does not get through calibration procedures, which is why it takes ages to boot (and indicates a problem)
- The keyboard is *very* dirty but I can't get to it with those remaining two screws stuck in (fix, call Evert?)
- Power supply fuses are all OK, so that doesn't seem to be the issue
- Long boot up time suggests "something not reacting", which is in line with the wheels not doing much if anything

Solutions:
- Fix the above; but given that it seems to work 100% fine with a MIDI input, no hurry!

Also try to sample something for fun, see how that works (and if it works).

Options for screw removal:
- Rubber band
- Pliers (good ones)
- Special bit

- Mount replacement board when current one stops working.

[ Cables ]

I need more:

Balanced audio cable
MIDI interface for PC
USB to "printer USB", long, 2X
Small jack to RCA (same one you got before)
Regular RCA cable

Go look in Helsingborg.

[ Environment ]

- More desk space!
- Upgrade mixer
- Plateaus, maybe ask Maurits to design something?
