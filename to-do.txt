[ Gear / Maintenance ]

*Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

Issues:
- It does not get through calibration procedures, which is why it takes ages to boot (and indicates a problem)
- The keyboard is *very* dirty but I can't get to it with those remaining two screws stuck in (fix, call Evert?)
- Power supply fuses are all OK, so that doesn't seem to be the issue
- Long boot up time suggests "something not reacting", which is in line with the wheels not doing much if anything

Solutions:
- Fix the above; but given that it seems to work 100% fine with a MIDI input, no hurry!

Also try to sample something for fun, see how that works (and if it works).

14/12: So, it's a simple machine, what to replace?

* Yamaha DX-7

Issue:
- Battery? It seems enough

Solution:
- Buy new battery, get MIDI interface

* Arturia Drumbrute

- Mount replacement board when current one stops working.

[ Cables ]

I need more:

X * Long MIDI cables, at least 2
X * At least 1 USB to "printer USB", long, best 2
X * Small jack to RCA (longer than the same one you got before)
X * Regular RCA cable

** ORDER! **

[ Environment ]

- More desk space!
- Upgrade mixer
- Plateaus, maybe ask Maurits to design something?
