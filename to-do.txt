[ Gear / Maintenance ]

*Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

Issues:
- It does not get through calibration procedures, which is why it takes ages to boot (and indicates a problem)
- Keyboard is blown, I think the wheels are the issue but who knows..
- Disk drive acts shifty but that could very well be the disks themselves.
- Long boot up time suggests blown capacitors as well (Google..).

Solutions:
- Fix the above; but given that it seems to work 100% fine with a MIDI input, no hurry!

Also try to sample something for fun, see how that works (and if it works).

14/12: So, it's a simple machine, what to replace?

* Yamaha DX-7

Issue:
- Battery (even though it only complained once).
- Internal patches

Solution:
- Buy new battery, get MIDI interface

* Arturia Drumbrute

- Mount replacement board when current one stops working.

[ Cables ]

I need more:

* Long MIDI cables, at least 2
* At least 1 USB to "printer USB", long, best 2
* Big plugs to RCA (with or without converter pieces), 2
* Long stereo single big jack to 2 mono big jacks, 2
* Small jack to RCA (longer than the same one you got before)
* Regular RCA cable

[ Environment ]

- More desk space!
- Plateaus, maybe ask Maurits to design something?
- New pedal!
