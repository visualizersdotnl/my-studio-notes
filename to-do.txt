[ Gear / Maintenance ]

*Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

Issues:
- Seems to work 90% (I can hear some clicks every now and then I don't think should be there) sound wise.
- Keyboard is blown; it is always modulating and the pitch wheel does not respond.
- Disk drive acts shifty but that could very well be the disks themselves.
- Long boot up time suggests blown capacitors as well (Google..).

Solutions:
- Open up the machine and look at it's state; might be easy enough to replace a few capacitors *but*
  also check out the online replacement manuals and even parts before going at it yourself.
  Focus on the keys.
- Replace the disk drive: the coolest would be to get a diskette drive using a memory card and start sampling yourself.

Also try to sample something for fun, see how that works (and if it works).

* Yamaha DX-7

- Battery (even though it only complained once).

* Arturia Drumbrute

- Mount replacement board when current one stops working.

[ Cables ]

I need more:

* Long MIDI cables, at least 2
* At least 1 USB to "printer USB", long, best 2
* Big plugs to RCA (with or without converter pieces), 2
* Long stereo single big jack to 2 mono big jacks, 2

[ Environment ]

- More desk space!
- Plateaus, maybe ask Maurits to design something?
