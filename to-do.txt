[ Gear / Maintenance ]

* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- Clean the entire thing
- Replace electrolytic caps on PSU (if you think it's worth it if MIDI works well)
- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached

Solutions:
- Clean and reseat all: go from there

Also try to sample something for fun, see how that works (and if it works).

Options for screw removal:
- Rubber band
- Pliers (good ones)
- Special bit

[ Cables ]

I need more:

Balanced audio cable
MIDI interface for PC
USB to "printer USB", long
Small jack to RCA (same one you got before)
Regular RCA cable

Go look in Helsingborg.

[ Environment ]

- More desk space!
- Upgrade mixer
- Plateaus, maybe ask Maurits to design something?
