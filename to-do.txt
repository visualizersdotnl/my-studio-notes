* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached
- Laat Jasper er eens naar kijken!

[ Cables ]

I need more:

- 3-metre jack cables for TG77/Virus -> mixer.
- 3.5 stereo jack to 2 big jacks for Volca FM.

[ Environment ]

- Desk space for SL-1200s *and* DX7 (keyboard stand?)

[ Notes ]

- Pick up Juno-106 @ Thorsten
- See notes on iPhone, includes notes about DJ gear and other issues.
