[ Gear / Maintenance ]

* Gaming corner *

Cables (RGB) for:
- PlayStation 2
- Nintendo 64

And get a SCART switch

* SL-1200MK2s *

Give them a standard cleaning.

* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached

Solutions:
- Clean and reseat all: go from there

Try out sampling: format a lousy disk and try to record the DX7.

* Arturia Drumbrute

OK!
Board replaced.

MIDI interface for PC
MIDI cable(s)

[ Environment ]

- More desk space!
- Upgrade mixer (coming through Henrik!)
- Plateaus, maybe ask Maurits to design something?
