[ Gear / Maintenance ]

* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- Clean the entire thing
- Replace electrolytic caps on PSU (shipment incoming!)
- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached

Solutions:
- Clean and reseat all: go from there

Try out sampling: format a lousy disk and try to record the DX7.

Options for screw removal:
- Rubber band
- Pliers (good ones)
- Special bit

* Arturia Drumbrute

OK!
Board replaced.

[ Cables ]

I need more:

MIDI interface for PC
Small jack to RCA (same one you got before)
Regular RCA cable

Go look in Helsingborg.

[ Environment ]

- More desk space!
- Upgrade mixer
- Plateaus, maybe ask Maurits to design something?
