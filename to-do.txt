- Laat Jasper er eens naar kijken!

[ Cables ]

I need more:

- 3-metre jack cables for TG77 -> mixer.
- 3.5 stereo jack to 2 XLRs for Volca FM.
- Cables to hook mixer up to the Focusrite?

[ Environment ]

- Desk space for SL-1200s *and* DX7.

[ Notes ]

- Pick up Juno-106 @ Thorsten
- See notes on iPhone, includes notes about DJ gear and other issues.
