[Synth.]

* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached
- Laat Jasper er eens naar kijken!

* Yamaha DX-7

[ Cables ]

I need more:

- 2 1-metre jack cables for TG77 -> mixer.
- 1 3.5 stereo jack to 2 XLRs for Volca FM.

[ Environment ]

- Desk space for SL-1200s *and* DX7.

[ Notes ]

- Never trust that your Beyer's are broken unless you can check this using a reputable *direct* source!
- Pick up Juno-106 @ Thorsten
