[Synth.]

* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached
- Fucked around with wheel wiring (!)
- Laat Jasper er eens naar kijken!

[ Cables ]

I need more:

- 3-metre jack cables for TG77/Virus -> mixer.
- 3.5 stereo jack to 2 big jacks for Volca FM.

[ Patch bay ]

- Design and build one with Maurits
- Cables!
- Design goal: be able to patch *any* instrument (or DJ mixer) through to the speakers or the audio adapter, or both

[ Environment ]

- Desk space for SL-1200s *and* DX7 (keyboard stand?)

[ Notes ]

- Pick up Juno-106 @ Thorsten
- See notes on iPhone, includes notes about DJ gear and other issues.
