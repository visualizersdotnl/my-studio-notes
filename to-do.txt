MAIN RULE: THE ROOM MAY BE A MESS!

[ Gear / Maintenance ]

* Gaming corner *

Cables (RGB) for:
- PlayStation 2
- Nintendo 64

And get a SCART switch

[ SL-1200MK2s / Vinyls ]

Need a desk.

Clean up the records (see note on the wall).
Clean up the remaining SL-1200mk2.

* Ensoniq Mirage (the plagued one)

- MIDI works "well" after some adjustment and with the keyboard itself detached

Solutions:
- Clean and reseat all: go from there

Try out sampling: format a lousy disk and try to record the DX7.
